## About The App

This is a simple app that uses Chpter to make Mpesa payments.
We will create a callback url endpoint that will be used by Chpter to send us the payment details.
We then create orders that will be used to make the payments.
We will use Chpter to make the payments and then use Phoenix Live View to display the payment details.
It is a pre-requisite for the article i wrote on Medium

## Technologies

I used `Elixir `  and `Phoenix Live View` for this project.

## Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Hex Package

There is a hex package for chpter that I worked on. You can find it here [Chpter Hex package](https://hex.pm/packages/chpter) , and the full documentation here [Chpter Hex package Documentation ](https://hexdocs.pm/chpter/0.1.1/Chpter.html)
